        <h2>Website Details</h2>
        <p><strong>This site was largely made for fun.</strong> Otherwise you wouldn't be able to enjoy the space background, and the pretty colors! It's tacky sure, but isn't it neat to see what can be done with HTML, CSS, and a bit of elbow grease?</p>
        <p><strong>A sensationally abstract visit.</strong> This website's throwback styling was only possible because it was assembled myself. Through WordPress, Blogger, etc this wouldn't be possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Who are you?</strong> A young man who spent an absurd amount of time assembling and hosting a 90's esque website.</p>
        <p><strong>I wish there was more content...</strong> The only thing greatly unsatisfying about the end result is that if you exclude 'Paul's Playbook', this entire site can be experienced in a couple minutes. Speaking of content, since you're actually reading this I'll let you in on a secret- desktop users can find an easter egg on the main page, a typable cheat code perhaps? Anyway, I suppose the same applies to anyone creating an animated film, or anything not automated, but it really goes to show all the little graphics and details I put in, no matter how simple they are, have minimal correlation with the amount of consumable content.</p>
