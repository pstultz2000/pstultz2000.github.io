    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p><strong>Hey! I am Paul, my portfolio and photo essay are for a Photojournalism class I’m currently taking. Before I began, I only had experience with film photography- but I am not sure I want to go back after being spoiled with using a digital camera. Getting instant feedback on a digital camera is incredibly valuable and helps me learn real time what I need to do differently. Otherwise, one thing that taking this class made me realize was how much I didn’t know. I feel like just now, as I finish the final assignments for my journalism class, I am still becoming more comfortable with my camera.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ansel Adams is my favorite film photographer; I love his Zone System- if you are at all interested in B&W photography you should seriously check it out. My favorite capture of his is Dunes, Oceano. Feel free to send me message through the contact page!</strong></p>
