    <h4>Discover 'The Bananaverse': A Novel Crafted by Artificial Intelligence.</h4>
    <p>I mainly created this 'because I could', and I wanted to see what it took to actually publish a book. At the time, getting the space banana illustrations to come out well was incredibly hard with the software and hardware I had available at the time - this was before online AI picture generators were prevalent and could make good images reliably.<br><br>In my opinion, the final product ended up being a great showcase of what the early days of AI could create with the right prompting and guidance.</p>
