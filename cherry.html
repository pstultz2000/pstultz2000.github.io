    <h2>It takes less than 30 minutes! - Mid 2023</h2>
    <p><strong>If you can't legally have/drink liquor then do not do this, or consume alcohol.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Cherries in good condition, any kind of liquor, and sugar</p>
    <p><strong>Supplies:</strong> A clean glass jar, and something to boil the ingredients in</p>
    <p>For two dozen cherries, you'll need half a cup of your booze and a quarter cup sugar. Adjust portions as desired.</p>
    <p>Lightly boil your tequila and add in sugar, stir until dissolved. Cut the cherries in half or softly puncture them so they don't explode, and dump them in. Stir lightly, let simmer for five minutes. Lastly, put it all in the jar, seal it, and keep refrigerated.</p>
    <p>Overtime the cherries will get more enjuiced in the mixture. You can do this with other flavorings and less sugar too, but it will go bad faster.</p>
