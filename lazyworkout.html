    <h2>Simple and Effective Squat Workout - Written Mid 2023, revised 1/16/24</h2>
    <p><strong>Exercise Safely:</strong> Exercise caution while exercising, and maintain proper form.</p>
    <p><strong>Minimal Equipment Required:</strong> All you need is a weight plate. If you're new to squats, start without weights.</p>
    <p><strong>Only takes a few minutes!</strong> Perform squats while holding the weight plate, until it's time for a break.</p>
    <p>This might be challenging if you're just starting out, but you will definitely see benefits over time. Jumping squats have helped my blood pressure in the past, and can be done to make the workout more aerobic.</p>
    <p>Results can be seen within 3-7 days for beginners. For those more accustomed to fitness routines, results may vary based on individual strength and conditioning levels. Consistency is key.</p>
