    <h2>TL;DR: It's a massive undertaking, but there are similar, more realistic options. - 1/1/24</h2>
    <p>Bringing back a car from the dead is typically a multi-year process that will consume a fair amount of your free time for years, a good deal of money, and requires high levels of patience. You are near guaranteed to lose a great deal of money in the end, even if you do all the work yourself. Also, consider the space an undrivable car will take up.</p>
    <p>You must assume it will cost a lot more than you are projecting, as you will come across unexpected costs and more. You will probably need/want a professional paint job done, which is thousands alone. Then, at some point, you will realize that buying a brand new Mustang might not cost much more than what you're scoping out for this long, intense project - and could be even cheaper.</p>
    <p>
        This is not to muddy your dreams - even I need a wake-up call sometimes. But there are much easier, more affordable, and environmentally friendly options:</p>
    <p><strong>Fixing a running older but not classic car:</strong> There are plenty available that are still well-maintained, as well as greatly depreciated, and will still scratch the itch of wanting to fix a car. If you're brave and want more, go for something that needs TLC or a "mechanic's special".</p>
    <p><strong>Fix your current car yourself:</strong> Changing the oil on your Camry may not be exciting, but it is convenient and saves money! Mechanics sometimes do things wrong, and upcharging for parts by 3 to 4 times is pretty common. Doing one repair yourself can sometimes save hundreds of dollars.</p>
        <p>I hope this helps! Tried to condense what I've learned about restoration over the years.</p>
