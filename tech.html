    <p><strong><a href="voidloop.html">2D racing game with complex physics</a><br> Requires keyboard!</strong> Bug: On MacOS browsers, the spaceship has buffed stats and more stable handling than intended. Still playable, and if you are a speed control demon you might enjoy the bugged version more. Developer time was obtained without using bugs, increased stats, or exploits.<br><br>Completed the spaceship and track functionality in about four hours, my main focus was on adding elaborate and fairly challenging game physics, and the result was great. However, I did spend an additional six hours or more trying to render the ship in 3D and to add background graphics.<br><br>I was able to generate a 3D ship using Three.js, but I couldn't make it visible in the game. I modified and imported my JavaScript generated graphics, but the brisk shallow shore ended up being visually distracting, so I removed it. Adapting the original generative graphic files to work with the game was certainly extra work... Nevertheless, this experience taught me the importance of planning ahead and preparing for every aspect you want to implement in a project.<br><br><strong>Other functionality</strong> Everything other than the ship and track functionality and appearance took me a few more hours. The 'increase stats' feature I came across by accident! It works by adding another active "requestAnimationFrame" to the existing game loop. In total, I spent about fifteen hours on development.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="bg.html">Generative wave graphics using JavaScript</a><br></strong> Made this in 40 minutes, inspired by EarthBound's background battle graphics and wanted to see how quickly I could whip up my own version. I spent much of the time making the movement not shutter or be reminscent of epilipsy, and what I ended up with was something resembling waves. Found the right colors and it was good to go.<br><br>It allows all screen sizes, so you will have a different experience depending on the device/window size. The waves are supposed to overlap, but some mobile device screens will vertically stretch the display enough to cause gaps in between waves.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="guess.html">QR code game</a><br> Not optimized for mobile</strong> I designed this simple guessing game to be theoretically small enough to fit on a large QR code, particularly if the code is concatenated.<br><br>I was inspired by a guy online that did this with his simple version of 'Snake', but it only worked on Windows and the QR was way too big. My idea was to make it as practical as possible: A single code I could pull out of my pocket, that anyone could scan with their phone and load into their browser immediately.<br><br>The final result ended up being a near perfect balance between graphics and game logic. However, given the space limitations, if I was to do this again I would focus solely on graphics or gameplay due to space limitations.<br><br>I did not go through with actually making the QR code because it was going to be a lot more time for something that might not load, and honestly the gaming potential is limited. QR codes are generally just a link, so I would have to look more into a special website or software that could make the QR for me. Even if I made it, its possible that it would not work at all as this assumes the data would be loaded straight into a new page within the browser and is not treated as potential malware.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://squid.pizza">Squid.Pizza</a></strong><br>I built the current version of the site in under an hour, the creation process was pretty unremarkable but owning a fun 'useless website' was a strong desire of mine in middle school! I will probably add more to it eventually.<br><br>I tried making the squid mirrored while moving to make it look more like swimming, as well as incorperate my VisitPaul scroll bar, but they were not working without continual issues and I didn't want to go down a rabbit hole. If I add more functionality for squid.pizza it will probably link to new pages and/or include pizza. ... There is one other place on VisitPaul with a link to Squid.Pizza, can you find it?</p>
    <p>I probably will not make another graphical web game given the time it took, it was my first time, but 15 hours for borderline 70's graphics, and minimal options?<br><br><strong>I created a bare bones web browser</strong> a little while ago using Tkinter, Python, BeautifulSoup etc.. It has no security features, and I encoutered an error with getting it to load on other Windows PC's, so not sure I will ever make it publically available. If you are interested in trying it or learning more, let me know!</p>
